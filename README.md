This Voting System web application built using Django can serve as the automated voting system for organizations and/or institutions. The system works like the common election manual system of voting whereas the system must be populated by the list of the positions, candidates, and voters. The E-voting system can help a certain organization or school to minimize the voting time duration because aside providing the voters an online platform to vote, the system will automatically count the votes for each candidate. The system has 2 sides of the user interface which are the administrator and voters side. The admin user is in charge to populate and manage the data of the system and the voter side which is where the voters will choose their candidate and submit their votes.

## How the system works
Administrator is required to have created candidates. 
Before creating candidates, the admin must have created positions
After doing this, the voters can vote (provided that they are registered and verified)

## How do voters get verified ?
OTP is sent to voter's phone. In a case of OTP delivery error, voter can request for OTP again. 
The OTP is sent via an SMS gateway. 
Voters can request for OTP for a maximum of three times.
Same OTP is sent to voters

## Can OTP verification be bypassed ?
Yeah, sure.
Open `settings.py` and toggle `SEND_OTP` to  `False`
Then, wait till server restarts

## Open to contribution ?
Yeah. Pull requests are welcomed.
